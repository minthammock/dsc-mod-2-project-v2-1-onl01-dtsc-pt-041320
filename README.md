        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The Module 2 final project is an analysis and of the King County housing data set. The purpose of this analysis was to answer
            the following questions:
            <br>
            <br>
                \t <strong>• This is going to be question 1</strong>
            <br>
                \t<strong>• This is going to be question 2</strong>
            <br>
                \t<strong>• This is going to be question 3</strong>
            <br>
            The project was tackled using the OSIM data science framework with specific methodology that will be spelled out farther down on this page. This cover page will serve as a resource for navigating this repository and to provide context for the devices used in the jupyter notebook.
